# webpack-react-router-seed

A seed project to get free of wiring up webpack, gulp, webpack-dev-server, react-hot-reload, browser-sync, react, react-router.
 
## gulp tasks

`gulp eslint` - ESLint files

`gulp` - webpack-dev-server with hot module reload.

`gulp sync` - run with browser-sync, files are built into `build/`

`gulp build-webpack-production` - build production-ready files into `dist/`

#### todo

- refine webpack config
- webpack/gulp written in coffee. Nothing but to save type times.
- apply to airbnb eslint
- test flow
- integration test
- [optional] flow
